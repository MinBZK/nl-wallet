# Wallet App (Flutter)

This README explains how to configure the wallet app. It also contains the currently supported mock
scenarios, describes our conventions and project structure and finally offers information on the
design decisions we made in the Architecture section.

## Running the App

### Environment Setup

To run the app you need to configure Flutter, Rust, the Android SDK and the iOS SDK. See the project
root's [README.md](../README.md) for instructions on how to do so.

### Running

After setting up your environment, launch an Android emulator or the iOS simulator and execute:

- `flutter run` or
- `fvm flutter run` when using Flutter Version Manager (FVM)

Note that when using FVM, all Flutter commands below should be prefixed with `fvm`.

### Building

The easiest way to build the app locally is to use [fastlane](https://docs.fastlane.tools/).
To install use: `bundle install`.

#### iOS

To build the iOS app use: `bundle exec fastlane ios build`. Note that password for fastlane match
repository will be requested while building,
this repository is not public. Alternatively you can build the app using `flutter build ios`, which
will rely on your own certificate.

#### Android

To build the Android app use: `bundle exec fastlane android build`. Note that this requires you to
add a local signing key to the project:

1. Get the `nl-wallet-android-local-signing-key` secrets from the secrets repository.
2. Move `local-keystore.jks` file into the `wallet_app/android/keystore` folder.
3. Move the `key.properties` file into the `wallet_app/android` folder.
4. That's it! Building release builds, e.g. with `bundle exec fastlane android build` should now
   work.

### App Configuration

We are currently maintaining two 'flavours' of the app, a *mock* and an *core* version.

#### Mock

The mocked version is what is used to demonstrate and verify potential use cases of the app. This
version is preliminary used for usability research and contains many mock (fake) scenarios that can
be triggered using the [QR codes](../demo/qrs.md) or [Deeplinks](#deeplink-scenarios) provided
below. This version of the app does **not** require internet and thus does not require any server to
be running.

Running the mock variant of the app is straight forward, as it's currently the default behaviour
when using `flutter run`. But to explicitly run a mock build use:

```sh
flutter run --dart-define=MOCK_REPOSITORIES=true
```

#### Core

The 'core' version is of the app is what will (work in progress) grow into the functioning MVP. It
relies heavily on all the logic implemented in the [`wallet_core`](../wallet_core/README.md), which
is the component that handles all the business logic (like storage, network and validation) needed
to achieve the app's functionalities.

A sample command to run the *core* version of the app is provided below. Note that the universal link
needs to be configured using various environment variables, as is illustrated in this example.

```sh
UL_HOSTNAME={hostname} UNIVERSAL_LINK_BASE="https://{hostname}/path" flutter run --dart-define UL_HOSTNAME={hostname}
```

However, since the core version relies heavily on communication with other services, we also provide
scripts to configure the complete development environment. Please refer to [scripts](../scripts/),
and more specifically the `setup-devenv.sh` and `start-devenv.sh` files.

##### Configuration

The configuration for how the app can connect to the configuration server (which serves the wallet
configuration) is compiled directly into the app (`wallet_core/config-server-config.json`).
In addition, the initial wallet configuration (`wallet_core/wallet-config.json`)
(the most recent version at the time the app is built) is compiled into the app as well.
These configurations are parsed and verified at compile time.

In order to make sure the wallet configuration belongs to the environment the app is built for,
an environment variable named `CONFIG_ENV` is used.
If, for instance, the app is built for the demo environment, `CONFIG_ENV` should have the value `demo`.
This check is always performed, but when the `--release`-flag is passed to Cargo, the `CONFIG_ENV`
environment variable is mandatory. Without the `--release`-flag the default (`dev`) is used.

##### Key and app attestation

The app performs key and app attestation when registering with the Wallet Provider (i.e. after the
user first enters their PIN code). As verifying these attestations is mandatory, special care needs
to be taken to make sure that attestation can be be performed for a particular environment.

###### iOS

For iOS key and app attestation to succeed, the following variables will need to match between the
app and the Wallet Provider:

1.  The root CA with which the attestation is signed.
2.  Apple's attestation environment, which can be either *development* (i.e. a sandbox environment)
    or *production*.
3.  The app's bundle identifier.

When running the app on real hardware, the root CA is always the one provided by Apple, as the
attested key is stored within the Secure Element on the device.

However, the iOS simulator is not capable of generating attested keys. For this use case a
provision has been implemented that generates faux attestations under a self-signed CA. Generating
these attestations can be enabled through the `fake_attestation` cargo feature. When compiling
through Xcode (or indeed `flutter run`), this is done automatically when the target is the iOS
simulator. The included setup script (for a local development environment) will automatically
configure the Wallet Provider to accept both attestations signed by Apple and these faux
self-signed attestations. In short, running the app on the iOS simulator against a local
development environment should work out of the box.

The attestation environment is set to *development* by default. This can be overridden by setting
the `APPLE_ATTESTATION_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable during compilation. Note that this is
ignored for builds that are downloaded from TestFlight or the App Store, as (per the Apple
documentation) these always use the production environment. For this reason, the *development*
environment should only be used during local development, while any deployed environment will use
*production*.

The bundle identifier need not be changed for the local development environment. For other
environments it can be changed using:

bash
```
flutter pub run rename setBundleId --targets ios --value <BUNDLE ID>
```

###### Android

Any real Android device that has either a TEE as part of its SoC or a separate StrongBox should
generate attested keys that pass validation. The included setup script will configure the Wallet
Provider to accept keys that are signed by a CA that uses Google's published public key.

For the Android emulator to work, the following requirements will need to be met:
* The emulator should be running the Android 34 system images with Play Store support. This is currently the only known version to work, as it includes known pre-generated root CAs.
* The `wallet_provider` should have the `allow_android_emulator_keys` Cargo feature enabled, which lowers the attested key requirements to allow keys generated in software. Note that this feature should never be used in any production environment.

App attestation using Google Play integrity is not yet implemented.

## File Structure

### Assets

All files used by the project (like images, fonts, etc.), go into the `assets/` directory and their
appropriate sub-directories.

Note; the `assets/non-free/images/` directory
contains [resolution-aware images](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#resolution-aware).

> Copyright note: place all non free (copyrighted) assets used under the `non-free/` directory
> inside the appropriate asset sub-directory.

### Localization

Text localization is enabled; currently supporting English & Dutch, with English set as primary (
fallback) language. Localized messages are generated based on `ARB` files found in the `lib/l10n`
directory.

To support additional languages, please visit the tutorial
on [Internationalizing Flutter apps](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization).

Internally, this project uses the commercial Lokalise service to manage translations. This service
is currently not accessible for external contributors. For contributors with access, please
see [documentation/lokalise.md](./documentation/lokalise.md) for documentation.

### Deeplink Scenarios

Below you can find the deeplinks that can be used to trigger the supported mock scenarios.
On Android, the scenarios can be triggered from the command line by
using `adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "{deeplink}"`.
On iOS, the scenarios are triggered with the command `xcrun simctl openurl booted '{deeplink}'`.
Note that the deeplinks only work on debug builds. For **mock** production builds you can generate a
QR code from the content and scan these using the app. Pre-generated QR codes are also available,
and can be found [here](../demo/qrs.md).

## Conventions

This section specifies some of the conventions we use to format our .dart code. These are mostly
enforced by the linter as well.

### Dart

- Max. line length is set to 120 (Dart defaults to 80)
- Relative imports for all project files below `src` folder; for
  example: `import 'bloc/wallet_bloc.dart';`
- Trailing commas are added by default; unless it compromises readability

### Naming

- Folder naming is `singular` for folders below `src`; for example: `src/feature/wallet/widget/...`

### Testing

#### Unit tests

- Test file name follows the convention: `{class_name}_test.dart`
- Test description (ideally) follows the convention: `should {do something} when {some condition}`
- Tests are grouped* by the method they are testing
- Run the unit tests: `flutter test --exclude-tags=golden --dart-define=MOCK_REPOSITORIES=true`

** Grouping tests by method is not required, but recommended when testing a specific method.

#### UI / Golden tests

- UI Tests are part of the normal test files
- UI Tests are grouped in `Golden Tests`

Even though they run headless, UI tests are slower to run. The main goal of these tests are to:

- Verify correct accessibility behaviour on different configurations (orientation/display
  scaling/font scaling/theming)
- Detect unexpected UI changes

As such we aim to keep the UI tests minimal, focusing on testing the most important states for a
screen. This can be done by providing a mocked bloc with the state manually configured in the test.

Note that the UI renders slightly differ per platform, causing small diffs (and failing tests) when
verifying on a different host platform (e.g. mac vs linux). To circumvent this issue, we opted to
only run UI tests on mac hosts for now. Because of this it is vital to only generate
new goldens on a mac host. This can be done
with `flutter test --update-goldens --tags=golden <optional_path_to_single_test_file>`.

- To only verify goldens use `flutter test --tags=golden --dart-define=MOCK_REPOSITORIES=true`
- To only verify other tests use `flutter test --exclude-tags=golden --dart-define=MOCK_REPOSITORIES=true`

##### Widget Test Template

To be as consistent as possible when it comes to testing widget we provide the following template.
This can be used as a starting point when writing widget tests:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:golden_toolkit/golden_toolkit.dart';

void main() {
  group('goldens', () {
    testGoldens(
      'light text',
          (tester) async {
        await tester.pumpWidgetWithAppWrapper(
          Text('T'),
        );
        await screenMatchesGolden(tester, 'text/light');
      },
    );
    testGoldens(
      'dark text',
          (tester) async {
        await tester.pumpWidgetWithAppWrapper(
          Text('T'),
          brightness: Brightness.dark,
        );
        await screenMatchesGolden(tester, 'text/dark');
      },
    );
  });

  group('widgets', () {
    testWidgets('widget is visible', (tester) async {
      await tester.pumpWidgetWithAppWrapper(
        Text('T'),
      );

      // Validate that the widget exists
      final widgetFinder = find.text('T');
      expect(widgetFinder, findsOneWidget);
    });
  });
}
```

## Architecture

The project uses the [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) package to handle state
management.

On top of that it follows the [BLoC Architecture](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture) guide,
with a slightly fleshed out domain layer.

This architecture relies on three conceptual layers, namely:

- [UI Layer](#ui-layer)
- [Domain Layer](#domain-layer)
- [Data Layer](#data-layer)

![Architecture Overview](./architecture_overview.png)

### UI Layer

Responsible for displaying the application data on screen.

In the above diagram the **UI** node likely represents a `Widget`, e.g. in the form of a `xyzScreen`
, that observes the Bloc using one of the `flutter_bloc` provided Widgets. E.g. `BlocBuilder`.

When the user interacts with the UI, the UI is responsible for sending a corresponding `Event` to
the associated BLoC. The BLoC then processes this event and emits an updated `State` to the UI,
causing the UI to rebuild and render the new state.

### Domain Layer

Encapsulate business logic to make it reusable. UseCases are likely to be used by BLoCs to interact
with data, allowing the BLoCs to be concise and keep their focus on converting events into new
states.

Naming convention `verb in present tense + noun/what (optional) + UseCase` e.g. LogoutUserUseCase.

### Data Layer

Exposes application data to the rest of the application. This is where we expose the CRUD and
network operations. Due to our current requirement of maintaining a 'mock' and a 'core' variant
this is the layer where the distinction is made, by injecting either a 'mock' or a 'core' version
of the `TypedWalletCore` based on the `MOCK_REPOSITORIES` compile time flag. The repositories in
term rely on this `TypedWalletCore` class to perform all the interactions.

### Motivation

The reason we opted for this BLoC layered approach with the intermediary domain layer is to optimize
for: Re-usability, Testability and Readability.

**Re-usable** because the usecases in the domain layer are focused on a single task, making them
convenient to re-use in multiple blocs when the same data or interaction is required on multiple (
ui) screens.

**Testable** because with the abstraction to other layers in the form of dependencies of a class,
the dependencies can be easily swapped out by mock implementations, allowing us to create small,
non-flaky unit tests of all individual components.

**Readable** because with there is a clear separation of concerns between the layers, the UI is
driven by data models (not by state living in UI components) and can thus be easily inspected, there
is a single source of truth for the data in the data layer and there is a unidirectional data flow
in the ui layer making it easier to reason about the transitions between different states.

Finally, since while we are developing the initial Proof of Concept it is unlikely that we will be
working with real datasources, this abstraction allows us to get started now, and in theory quickly
migrate to a fully functional app (once the data comes online) by replacing our MockRepositories /
MockDataSources with the actual implementations, without touching anything in the Domain or UI
Layer.

## App Distribution

### TestFlight iOS app distribution

The iOS app is distributed through our CI/CD pipeline, but one can follow the steps below in order
to deliver a test version of the iOS app to users via TestFlight manually.

#### Prerequisites

- Apple ID with access to App Store Connect
- App-specific password
- Fastlane Match Passphrase

*Credentials and access are available within the team (ask around).*

#### Setup prerequisites (1 time action)

- Login to appleid.com
- Create an App-specific password
- Store the created App-specific password & fastlane username/password as environment variables:

```sh
export FASTLANE_USER="{AppleID email address}"
export FASTLANE_PASSWORD="{Fastlane Match Passphrase}"
export FASTLANE_APPLE_APPLICATION_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD="{App-specific password}"
```

#### Build & upload IPA

- Run `bundle install` from the project root folder
- Run `bundle exec fastlane match appstore --readonly`  to locally install App Store certificate &
  provisioning profile (password protected: "Fastlane Match Passphrase")
- Place the latest configuration JSON files for the `ont` environment under `wallet_core/wallet/`, these can be downloaded from the CI as an asset
- Check latest iOS build number
  here: [App Store Connect - iOS Builds](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps/SSSS/testflight/ios),
  next build number needs to be `{latest_build_numer} + 1`
- Build app with updated build
  number `CONFIG_ENV=ont UL_HOSTNAME=app.example.com UNIVERSAL_LINK_BASE="https://app.example.com/deeplink/" bundle exec fastlane ios build app_store:true build:{next_build_number} bundle_id:nl.ictu.edi.wallet.latest app_name:"NL Wallet (latest)" universal_link_base:app.example.com`
- Upload to TestFlight `bundle exec fastlane ios deploy bundle_id:nl.ictu.edi.wallet.latest`  (login
  with Apple ID + password; app specific password!)
