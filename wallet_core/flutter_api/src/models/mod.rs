//! This module contains models that represent data coming from `wallet-core` that should be represented in Flutter.
//!
//! Flutter-rust-bridge (frb) offers functionality to scan external crates and generate bridging code for it. However,
//! there are quite some limitations to this approach:
//! - unit structs cannot be parsed;
//! - frb needs to parse and generate code for every type that is used in Flutter. Examples of external types that cause
//!   problems are IndexMap and Uri;
//!
//! This leaves us to either use a subset of Rust for the models that need to be translated or create separate mapping
//! models. The former option places severe limitations on how Rust can be used in `wallet-core`. The latter option is
//! chosen here, even though it causes a lot of duplication.
