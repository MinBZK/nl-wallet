/// This macro is to be used for all API functions that are exposed to Flutter
/// via `flutter-rust-bridge`. Unfortunately, the bridging code generated can only
/// propagate error values as Dart exceptions if the [`anyhow::Result`] type is used.
/// In order to transmit error details to Flutter, the [`anyhow::Error`] type will
/// contain a JSON encoded string for errors we know the [`wallet::wallet::Wallet`] to
/// produce.
///
/// For this macro to make sense in the context in which it is used, its input should
/// also be a [`anyhow::Result`]. This way, the function to which it is applied will
/// actually seen to return the correct result type.
///
/// To convert one [`anyhow::Result`] to another [`anyhow::Result`] this macro takes
/// the following steps:
///
/// 1. Wrap the function to which is is applied in a closure that is called immediately. This function may or may not be
///    `async`. The effect of this is that any use of the `?` operator to convert and return error values is contained
///    and performed within the closure.
/// 2. Any [`anyhow::Error`] resulting from the closure is converted to a [`crate::errors::FlutterApiError`], using its
///    [`TryFrom`] trait implementation. If this conversion fails, the [`anyhow::Error`] is simply propagated.
/// 3. The [`crate::errors::FlutterApiError`] is logged using [`tracing`], by using the [`Display`] and [`Debug`] traits
///    on the error.
/// 4. A new [`anyhow::Error`] is created and propagated, containing the [`crate::errors::FlutterApiError`] encoded as
///    JSON as its message. On the Flutter side, this message can be extracted from the resulting `FfiException`.
