//! Unifies working with both Android and iOS key and app attestation.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! The design of this functionality is divided into three groups of related types:
//!
//! 1. The bridging types defined in the private submodule `bridge::attested_keys` of this crate.
//!    These are simply the Rust versions of the types defined in the `platform_support.udl` and
//!    are designed to unify the behaviour of both Android and iOS key and app attestation.
//!    See the documenting comments in the UDL file mentioned for additional information.
//! 2. The traits and types in this crate, that provide a generic interface wrapping the functionality
//!    provided by the bridging types. This allows switching between the real hardware backed
//!    implementation and a fake "mock" implementation, which is used during testing.
//!    It also makes the interface of the bridged types a bit more rusty, as the types described in
//!    UDL have certain restrictions.
//! 3. The concrete implementations of the traits, both the ones wrapping the bridging types in the
//!    [`hardware`] submodule and the mock ones in `software`. Note that the latter is not currently
//!    implemented.
//!
//! ## Traits and supporting types
//!
//! The [`AttestedKeyHolder`] trait is designed to be a singleton can can be used to create new
//! attested keys or instantiate existing ones. The latter results in a [`AttestedKey`] enum,
//! which contains either the Apple or Google key type. These implement the [`AppleAttestedKey`] and
//! [`GoogleAttestedKey`] traits respectively.
//!
//! [`AppleAttestedKey`] simply provides a `sign()` method that returns [`AppleAssertion`], which is
//! a wrapper around [`Vec<u8>`] for semantic reasons. These bytes are meant to be sent to a server
//! for verification.
//!
//! [`GoogleAttestedKey`] on the other hand has [`SecureEcdsaKey`] as its supertrait, meaning that
//! this type supports generating ECDSA signatures. Additionally, it provides a `delete()` method
//! to delete the attested key from storage.
//!
//! When [`AttestedKeyHolder`] is used to attest a new key through its `attest()` method, a
//! [`KeyWithAttestation`] enum is returned instead. Apart from containing a key type, it also
//! contains platform specific attestation data that is to be sent to a server. Any error resulting
//! from this method is wrapped in [`AttestationError`], which simply adds a `retryable` boolean.
//!
//! Note that only one unique key type per identifier can be held in memory at one time, as otherwise
//! a key could be used after deleting it. This would lead to undefined behaviour. For this reason
//! instantiating a second key for an identifier results in an error.
//!
//! ## Real device ("hardware") implementation
//!
//! The concrete implementation of the attested key traits provide a thin wrapper around the bridging
//! code, implementing the uniqueness checking mentioned above.
//!
//! * The [`hardware::HardwareAttestedKeyHolder`] type implements the [`AttestedKeyHolder`] trait and
//!   can be created through its implementation of [`Default`].
//! * The [`hardware::AppleHardwareAttestedKey`] type implements the [`AppleAttestedKey`] trait.
//! * The [`hardware::GoogleHardwareAttestedKey`] type implements the [`GoogleAttestedKey`] trait.
//! * The concrete error type for all of these implementations is the
//!   [`hardware::HardwareAttestedKeyError`] enum.
//! * The key types make use of an internal helper type `HardwareAttestedKey`, which encapsulates
//!   shared functionality between these types.
//!
//! ## Mock implementation
//!
//! TBD
