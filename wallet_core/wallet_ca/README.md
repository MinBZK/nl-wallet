# Wallet Ca

Wallet CA is a command-line utility for generating X.509 certificates and private keys. It supports creating self-signed Certificate Authorities (CAs), as well as certificates for mdoc issuers, relying parties (readers), and token status lists, either with newly generated key pairs or based on existing public keys.
