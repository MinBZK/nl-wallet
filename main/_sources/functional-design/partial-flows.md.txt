# Partial Flows

The functional design (FD) describes recurring **partial flows** within the
system. These capture fragments of interaction between the user and external  
systems that appear multiple times across different scenarios, including 
variations and possible errors. They ensure consistency and clarity in how  
the system handles repeated patterns of behaviour. Read more about 
[how the functional design is formalized](functional-design).
