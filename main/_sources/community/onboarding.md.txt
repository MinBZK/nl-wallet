# Onboarding

An organization can opt to join the [NL Wallet Community][1]. This community is
intended for partners that are working on software that implements a verifier or
issuer which they want to test with NL Wallet backend systems and mobile apps.

You can visit the [EDI page about the NL Wallet Community][1] for more details
about how to join the NL Wallet Community and which steps to follow.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="title">Should you join the NL Wallet Community?</p>
<p>The NL Wallet Community is intended for organizations that develop issuers
and verifiers or other related softwares that would benefit from being able to
test within the NL Wallet ecosystem, i.e., its backend and mobile apps.</p>
<p>If you just want to develop issuers, verifiers or other kinds of software,
you *can* do that [locally][2] without onboarding to our community platform.
Only when you have a specific need to test integrations with the platform
itself, would you need to consider onboarding with the NL Wallet Community.</p>
