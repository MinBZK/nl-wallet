# Disclosure-based Issuance

Disclosure based issuance allows an attestation issuer to issue attestations to a wallet based on the contents of attributes disclosed by that same wallet.

The flow starts when the user scans a QR code, or taps on a UL, that starts the disclosure based issuance flow.
The wallet then presents a disclosure screen to the user, which upon user consent is followed immediately by an issuance screen presenting the new attestations.
In between the two screens, the issuer receives the disclosed attributes, and can use those to determine the contents of the attestation(s) to be issued.

The issuer side of this functionality is implemented by the `issuance_server` binary under `wallet_core/wallet_server`.

Technically, disclosure based issuance is achieved as follows:

  1. At the end of the disclosure session, the `issuance_server` sends the disclosed attributes to a preconfigured HTTP endpoint, at which the issuer must run an HTTP server that must respond with the attestations to be issued. This server is called the *attestation server*.

  2. The `issuance_server` starts an OpenID4VCI session in the [Pre-Authorized Code Flow][1], puts the Pre-Authorized Code into an [OpenID4VCI Credential Offer][2], and URL-encodes that into the `redirect_uri` that gets sent to the wallet.

  3. Using the Credential Offer with the Pre-Authorized Code within it, the wallet performs the OpenID4VCI session with the `issuance_server`.

## API

### Attestation server

The attestation server exchanges disclosed attributes for attestations to be issued. It is contacted by the `issuance_server` during a disclosure based issuance session to do this. Note that this server does not need to be reachable by the wallet, and it probably should not be directly connected to the internet.

The attestation server receives an HTTP `POST` by the `issuance_server` containing a JSON structure of the same form as the `/disclosed_attributes` endpoint of the `verification_server` returns (see our [openapi specifications](../../development/openapi-specifications)). More specifically, this is a JSON-serialized `IndexMap<String, DocumentDisclosedAttributes>`. For example:

```http
POST / HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: */*
Host: localhost:51560
Content-Length: 267

[
  {
    "id": "my_credential",
    "attestations": [
      {
        "attestation_type": "com.example.pid",
        "attributes": {
          "com.example.pid": {
            "bsn": "999991772"
          }
        },
        "issuer_uri": "https://cert.issuer.example.com/",
        "attestation_qualification": "QEAA",
        "ca": "ca.pid.example.com",
        "validity_info": {
          "signed": "2025-04-15T07:02:26Z",
          "valid_from": "2025-04-15T07:02:26Z",
          "valid_until": "2026-04-15T07:02:26Z"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The `attestation_server` must respond with a JSON-serialized `Vec<IssuableDocument>`. For example:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

[
  {
    "attestation_type": "com.example.degree",
    "attributes": {
      "university": "Example university",
      "education": "Example education",
      "graduation_date": "1970-01-01",
      "grade": "A",
      "cum_laude": true
    }
  }
]
```

The JSON array may be empty (i.e. `[]`) to indicate that no attestations to be issued were found. In that case, the wallet will present a screen to the user explaining that there were no attestations found that can be issued.

## Sequence diagram

This diagram shows how we compose OpenID4VP with OpenID4VCI in the pre-authorized code flow to issue attestations based on the contents of other attestations.

The flow starts with the user scanning a QR code or tapping a UL that contains the URL to the disclosure based issuer. When the wallet contacts the issuer using this URL, it starts a disclosure session requesting some preconfigured set of attributes that will allow it to determine the attributes that it wants to issue. For example, suppose the issuer wishes to issue academic degrees based on the user's BSN, then it would preconfigure an Authorization Request that requests the BSN from the PID.

After the user has disclosed the requested attributes, the issuer sends those to an internal endpoint that responds with the attestations to be issued. In the earlier mentioned example, this would be a database containing academic degrees indexed by BSNs.

Finally, the issuer issues the attestations using OpenID4VCI in the pre-authorized code flow.

During OpenID4VCI, the issuer requires the wallet to include the keys of the attestations that it disclosed earlier in its Proof of Association (PoA) when it sends its Proofs of Possession (PoPs) for the keys of the attestation (copies). This enforces that the newly issued attestations are bound to the same WSCD as the one that disclosed the attestations in the first part of the protocol.
