module:
  name: rp_session_attribute

G1:
  text: RP establishes that the attribute is a factually correct statement about the user at LoA High.
  supportedBy: [S1]
  inContextOf: [A1.1, A1.2, A1.3, A1.4, A1.5, A1.6]

A1.1:
  text: Attribute correctness depends on the trustworthiness of the issuer.

A1.2:
  text: Attribute correctness requires cryptographic protection to prevent tampering.

A1.3:
  text: Attribute correctness requires binding between the attribute and the correct user.

A1.4:
  text: Factual correctness at LoA High requires that the issuer performed LoA-High identity proofing at issuance.

A1.5:
  text: Sole control by the user is necessary to preserve the binding and prevent unauthorized use.

A1.6:
  text: The relying party’s validation is necessary to establish correctness at the time of use.

S1:
  text: Decompose into issuer trust, cryptographic integrity, correct user binding, LoA-High issuance assurance, WB enforces sole control, verifier validation.
  supportedBy: [G1.1, G1.2, G1.3, G_WbEnforcesSoleControl, G1.5]

G1.1:
  text: The attribute originates from a trusted issuer and maintains cryptographic integrity.
  supportedBy: [Sn1.1, Sn1.2, Sn1.3]

G1.2:
  text: The attribute is bound to the correct, authenticated user.
  supportedBy: [G_SoleControl]
  inContextOf: [A1.2.1, A1.2.2, A1.2.3]

A1.2.1:
  text: User binding requires sole control over the PID.

A1.2.2:
  text: Issuer can best enforce sole control conditions at issuance.

A1.2.3:
  text: Binding requires issuing the PID to a unique, trusted wallet instance.

G1.3:
  text: The attribute was issued to the correct person at LoA High.
  supportedBy: [G1.3.1]
  inContextOf: [A1.3.1, A1.3.2, A1.3.3]

A1.3.1:
  text: LoA High requires strong identity proofing during PID issuance.

A1.3.2:
  text: Secure issuance to a single trusted wallet is necessary for binding integrity.

A1.3.3:
  text: Issuer must ensure PID is delivered to the correct authenticated person.

G1.3.1:
  text: PID issuer securely issues the PID of the correct authenticated person to a single trusted wallet.
  supportedBy: []
  undeveloped: true



G1.5:
  text: Verifier performs required validation checks.
  supportedBy: [Sn1.5.1, Sn1.5.2, Sn1.5.3, Sn1.5.4]

Sn1.1:
  text: Evidence from the trust framework confirms the issuer is accredited and authorised to issue the attribute.

Sn1.2:
  text: Cryptographic verification confirms the attribute was issued by the trusted issuer and has not been modified.

Sn1.3:
  text: The attribute includes issuer identifiers, signing key references and issuance timestamps enabling validation of origin and integrity.


Sn1.5.1:
  text: Verifier validates the issuer’s cryptographic signature and trust chain using authoritative trust lists and metadata registries.

Sn1.5.2:
  text: Verifier checks that the attribute satisfies policy requirements (correct LoA, required claims, semantic correctness, and no over-disclosure).

Sn1.5.3:
  text: Verifier confirms that the attribute has not expired and is not revoked using the issuer’s status endpoints or revocation registries.

Sn1.5.4:
  text: Verifier checks that the presentation is bound to the correct holder (e.g., via proof of possession of key material) according to OpenID4VP or equivalent holder-binding requirements.
