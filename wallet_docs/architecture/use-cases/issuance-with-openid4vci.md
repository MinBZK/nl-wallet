# Issuance with OpenID4VCI

We currently (2025-10-25) have two issuance implementations: The `pid_issuer`,
a specialized issuer specifically for [PID][1]s, and `issuance_server` a
reference generic issuer that can issue all kinds of things. We'll cover both
in this document.

## PID issuance

PID issuance is done by the `pid_issuer` which is a part of the
`wallet_server` crate. It is created to issue [PID][1]s specifically.

This diagram below shows how the `pid_issuer` uses [OpenID4VCI][2] in a
[Pre-Authorized Code Flow][3] to issue a [PID] to the wallet.

Using this protocol, the wallet starts a normal OpenID Connect session at an
`AuthServer` (which is a so-called [OpenID Provider][4]; in the case of the NL
Wallet, this usually means [DigiD][5] through [nl-rdo-max][6]), from which it
obtains an authorization code.

Next, the wallet uses this code to start the OpenID4VCI issuance protocol in the
pre-authorized code flow with a `wallet_server` component called `pid_issuer`.
The `pid_issuer` finishes the OpenID Connect session with the `AuthServer` to
discover the identity of the wallet user, allowing it to finish issuance.

In the diagram below we introduce an actor called the `PidAttributeService`,
whose responsibility it is to produce the attributes to be issued when given a
valid pre-authorized code.

In the case of PID issuance, the `pid_issuer` can do this by finishing the
OpenID Connect session that the wallet started. (The `PidAttributeService` is
a part of the `pid_issuer` in the `wallet_server` crate, as opposed to a
separate HTTP server; we include it here as separate actor to clearly visualize
separate responsibilities.)

The protocol works as follows:

  * The wallet starts an OpenID Connect session at the `AuthServer` by sending
    it an Authorization Request, receiving an authorization code from the
    `AuthServer` in response;

  * Using the received authorization code, the wallet starts OpenID4VCI issuance
    in a so-called pre-authorized code flow by sending a `POST` request with the
    previously obtained code as a pre-authorized code in a Token Request to the
    `pid_issuer`;

  * The `pid_issuer` feeds the Token Request with the pre-authorized code to its
    `PidAttributeService` component. The `PidAttributeService` `POST`'s the
    Token Request to the `AuthServer`, transforming only the pre-authorized code
    in it to a normal authorization code but keeping the other parameters (such
    as the `state` and the PKCE `code_verifier`) in the Token Request as-is,
    thereby continuing the OpenID Connect session that the wallet previously
    started, and obtaining an `access_token`;

  * Using the resulting `access_token`, the `PidAttributeService` invokes the
    `/userinfo` endpoint of the `AuthServer` to retrieve the BSN, with which it
    does a query to the [BRP][7], resulting in the attributes to be issued;

  * The `pid_issuer` then generates the `c_nonce` and an `access_token` of its
    own, and a preview of the attestations as a custom addition to the
    OpenID4VCI protocol, all of which it returns to the wallet;

  * With the `access_token` and a valid set of proofs of possession (signatures
    over the `c_nonce` validating against the public keys that the wallet wants
    to have in its PID), the wallet can access the `batch_credential` endpoint
    of the `pid_issuer` to obtain the attestations.

Notice that from the perspective of the `AuthServer`, the mobile operating
system (abreviated as "OS" in the diagram) acts as the User Agent in an OpenID
Connect session, and the `pid_issuer`'s `PidAttributeService` acts as the OpenID
Client. The former starts the session by navigating to the `AuthServer` with an
Authorization Request, and the latter resumes the session with Token and User
Info Requests.

The NL Wallet requires at least the SD JWT format for PID attestations. The MSO
mDoc can be issued as well. The attestation type and paths to the `login` claim
and the `recovery_code` are dynamically configured. See the `pid_attributes`
field in the `wallet-config.json` for details.

        WalletServer->>WalletServer: verify proofs,  WUA and PoA

```

## Generic issuance

Generic issuance is done by the `issuance_server` which is also a part of the
`wallet_server` crate. It is created to issue all kinds of attestations.

For generic issuance, we implement a `GenericAttributeService` as follows:

  * The issuer feeds it a bunch of to-be-issued attestations (e.g.
    `Vec<IssuableDocument>`) and receives a fresh pre-authorized token
    in return, which it sends to the wallet using a UL or QR;

  * When the `issuance_server` calls `getAttributes(pre-authorized_code)`
    on the `GenericAttributeService`, it looks up the attributes to be issued
    using the pre-authorized code and returns them.

This would look like the following diagram:
