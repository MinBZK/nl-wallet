# v0.5.0 (dev)

## Upgrading

- This release changes the PID issuer to issue a single card with both personal
  and address claims instead of two distinct cards. Any verifiers must be
  updated to reflect this change.

## New features

- The Wallet Provider generates a Revocation Key during registration and sends
  this to the Wallet, while it stores an HMAC of the key in its database.
- Add 'manage notifications' screen to the app's settings menu.
- Display revocation code in the onboarding process.
- Show the build environment alongside the app version in the app.
- The wallet now shows notifications on the dashboard as well as in the mobile
  Operating System whenever an attestation is about to expire or has expired.
- The PID issuer now issues a single card with both personal and address claims.
