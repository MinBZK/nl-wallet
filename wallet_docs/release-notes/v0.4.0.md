# v0.4.0 (in development)

## Upgrading

- This release changes the identifiers used by the wallet and Wallet Provider to
  refer to the wallet's keys, invalidating existing keys and their identifiers.
  The WP's database will therefore have to be cleared when deploying this.
- Specifying for which attributes a relying party is authorized in a certificate
  has been made attestation format agnostic, meaning all existing certificates
  are invalid and should be regenerated to accommodate the new structure.
- The minimum size for the `ephemeral_id_secret` in the configuration of the
  `verification_server` has been increased from 16 to 32 bytes.
- The Wallet Provider no longer tracks in the database for each user if that
  user received a WUA. The corresponding column in the WP's user table has been
  removed, so the WP's database will therefore have to be cleared when deploying
  this.
- Switched configuration of mock relying party, issuance and verification server
  to use DCQL (Digital Credential Query Language) for defining credential
  queries. (see issuance_server.example.toml)
- The `disclosed_attributes` endpoint of the verifier no longer returns a JSON
  object keyed by the attestation type. Instead, it returns an array of
  attestation objects, with `attestation_type` added as a field in that object.
  This effectively removes the limitation that a particular attestation type can
  only appear once in disclosed attributes.
- The WTE acronym has been replaced by WUA across the codebase, including in the
  Wallet Provider and PID issuer configurations, as well as their database table
  and column names. These configurations will need to be updated and the
  database migrations will need to be fresly run. In addition, a variable in the
  wallet configuration has been renamed, so an updated wallet configuration will
  need to be deployed. Also the name of the HSM key has been changed.
- The database table `used_wuas` (previously known as `used_wtes`) is removed.
- flutter_rust_bridge has been updated to 2.11.1, run
  `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --locked --version 2.11.1` to
  update.
- In the wallet configuration `mdoc_trust_anchors` is renamed to
  `issuer_trust_anchors`.
- The Recovery Code will now be disclosed to the Wallet Provider after PID
  issuance. It will be stored in the Wallet Provider's database, so therefore
  the database will have to migrated when deploying this. For the Wallet
  Provider to be able to verify the disclosed Recovery Code, the Wallet
  Provider's configuration will need to be updated with the
  `pid_issuer_trust_anchors`.
- The disclosure query language used by OpenID4VP is now DCQL instead of
  Presentation Exchange. This has caused the JSON for both the verifier's
  `disclosed_attributes` endpoint and the `POST` endpoint of the attestation
  server as used for disclosure-based issuance to be changed. Please refer to
  the relevant portions of the documentation.
- The `/disclosed_attributes` of the `verification_server` now instead of
  returning a JSON object returns a JSON array, whose order matches that of the
  DCQL query that started the session.
- The pid_issuer, issuance_server and verification_server have now separate
  migration binaries.
- The `typ` field of JWTs is now consistently verified across the codebase.
  Previously, the Wallet configuration was erroneously set to `"JOSE+JSON"`,
  which should be changed to `"jwt"`.
- The minimum supported iOS version has been upgraded to iOS 15.0 (from iOS
  14.0).
- The minimum supported Android version has been upgraded to Android 10.0 - API
  29 (from Android 7.0 - API 24).
- The status field is now required in issued attestations. The field should be
  added to the SD-JWT VC Type metadata of issued attestations.
- The Wallet Provider now requires a keypair for signing Token Status Lists for
  the WUA.

## New features

- The wallet and Wallet Provider now use the SHA256 of the public keys to refer
  to the wallet's keys, so that the wallet's signing instructions to the WP are
  non-repudiable.
- The wallet now supports issued attributes containing 'null' and array values.
- The PID issuer now includes a new attribute called the recovery code, which is
  computed as the HMAC of the user's BSN.
- When identical attestations are issued, the wallet detects if the attestation
  already exists and renews the existing attestation. The only exception is that
  if the attestation will be valid in the future, the attestation will be
  treated as new.
- The wallet now start with an empty database on every new version.
- The `disclosed_attributes` endpoint of the verifier now includes the
  `attestation_qualification` field per disclosed attestation.
- The wallet now supports disclosing SD-JWT credentials and the verification
  server supports receiving them.
- The recovery code and login claims can be configured per PID attestation type
  in the wallet configuration.
- If the wallet user forgot their PIN, the wallet and wallet provider now
  support a protocol that allows the user to reauthenticate using DigiD and
  choose a new PIN.
- The PID issuer and the Issuance Server now maintain a table of issued
  attestation batches and the corresponding issued status token claims.
- The PID attestation types with recovery code has to be configured for the
  wallet-provider.
- The wallet supports selecting one of a set of candidate attestations for
  disclosure, if more than one matches the request.
- Issued attestations must now contain a `status` field, which is used to
  determine the revocation status of an attestation.
- When disclosing SD-JWT attestations, the wallet can now disclose an
  attestation having an attestation type that is extending the requested
  attestation type. The verification server should be configured to accept
  such attestations.
- The Wallet Provider now keeps track of the issued WUAs and their revocation
  status.

## Code improvements

- `ReaderRegistration` has been made attestation format agnostic, meaning the
  attributes specified in the reader certificate for which the relying party is
  authorized to request them are specified in a manner that works for both mdoc
  and SD-JWT attestations.
- The various instructions that the wallet used to send to the Wallet Provider
  during issuance and disclosure are now consolidated into two instructions, one
  for issuance and one for disclosure, that handle everything the wallet needs
  at once.
- The code now contains types that deal with Token Status Lists.
- The GBA tooling accepts a client certificate chain.

## Wallet app improvements

- The wallet now includes a 'video tour' screen, where users can watch short
  short video tutorials to learn about the functionalities of the app.
- The UI has been updated to support the 'pid renewal' flow. Currently only
  available in mock builds.
- Update to Flutter 3.35.6.
- The UI has been updated to support the 'pin recovery' flow. Currently only
  available in mock builds.
- The UI has been updated to support the Wallet Transfer (source & target) flow.
  Currently only available in mock builds.
- New 'Need help' and 'Contact' pages have been added to the menu, these are
  placeholders which will provide help for the end-user in the future.
- Add a new 'Demo' screen, shown on the initial start of the app to inform the
  user about the current pilot phase.

## Bug fixes

- The PoA provided by the wallet during disclosure now uses the nonce generated
  by the the verifier, instead of the nonce generated by the holder, in order to
  prevent a possible replay attack.

## CI changes

- Configure volume mounts more naturally (and aligned with other charts) via
  Helm values for update-policy-server and wallet-provider.
- Configure wallet-provider directly via Deployment instead of separate
  ConfigMap.
- Capture stdout/stderr from PKCS#11 library and log lines via log library to
  get structured logging.
- Base CI images on Debian Trixie.
- Using `extraPodLabels` (previously `extraPodlabels`) correctly cased in Helm
  charts.
- Using a Deployment for preload-gba-v-data pod to always keep pod alive.
- Helm charts have option to add additional annotations on Deployment or Cronjob
  resources.
- Checksum annotations in Helm charts for GBA pods is removed.
- Split building and signing for iOS build
- The wallet-provider ingress has an option to set the max client body size.
