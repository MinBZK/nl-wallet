# About

The NL Wallet is a digital tool, an app on your phone. It allows you to securely
identify yourself online and share personal information within the Netherlands
and Europe. The NL Wallet can thus provide access to online services from both
public and private organizations.

You can store various personal data in the NL Wallet. This includes personal
data from the Dutch personal records database (the BRP), such as your name and
date of birth. You can also store documents like diplomas and permits in the
NL Wallet. You can share specific data and see exactly what information you've
shared, with whom, and for what purpose.

The documentation you'll find here explains how the NL Wallet works and how you
can integrate applications with the NL Wallet platform.
