# Preparations

There are a few things to do and consider before you can start developing for
the NL Wallet. This short preparations note points you in the right directions
to make sure that everything works for local development, and mentions the
option of community onboarding for organizations.


## Local development

Before following the various getting started guides, it is imperative that you
have a fully-functioning local development environment. The development
requirements section of our git repository's [README.md][1] thoroughly covers
how to set up all the various software components, and how to execute tests,
run the backend services and run the mobile app on an Android emulator or iOS
simulator.

Make sure you follow all the steps and verify that you can execute all tests,
run the backend, and mobile app without errors before continuing with the guides
offered here.

## Community onboarding (optional)

Organizations that have a need for a closer partnering with the NL Wallet
eco-system, and that want to test integrations of their software with the
official NL Wallet backend and mobile apps, can opt to become a community
member.

Please see our [community onboarding documentation](/community/onboarding)
for more information about what to consider and how that works.
