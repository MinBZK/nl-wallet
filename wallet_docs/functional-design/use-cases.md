# Use Cases

The functional design (FD) describes **use cases** that define how users interact
with the system to achieve specific goals. Each use case outlines the steps of
the interaction, including the roles involved, the expected outcomes, and
possible variations or errors that may occur. Together, they provide a
structured view of the system’s functional behaviour. Read more about
[how the functional design is formalized](./about).
