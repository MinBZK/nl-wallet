# SD-JWT VC Profile

## Introduction

The NL Wallet, VV, and OV implement the
[SD-JWT VC Draft 08](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc-08)
[SD-JWT-VC] specification, with _additional constraints and customizations_
outlined in the profile below.

Our goal is to contribute to a fully interoperable EUDI framework that delivers
maximum value to users and organizations. Achieving this requires consensus on
standards and implementation profiles. To contribute to that consensus, this
profile reflects our current implementation and design preferences, based on the
experience from designing, developing and testing the NL Wallet. Note that it
should not be read as the final specifications of our product, or the broader
Dutch ecosystem. Nor is it an official position of the Dutch government.

Considerations that underpin the choices made in this profile are described in
[Profile considerations](#profile-considerations).

Ideally, the profile is temporary and our final product implements the same
specifications as all others within the EU and Dutch framework. Until that time,
attestation providers (issuers) and relying parties wishing to integrate with
the current development version of the NL Wallet, VV, and OV must adhere to this
profile.

## SD-JWT VC Type Metadata

### Type Metadata

- `extends`
    - OPTIONAL, A URI of another type that this type extends. See
      [Extending Types](#extending-types). `extends#integrity` is required when
      referring to an extended type.
- `extends#integrity`
    - OPTIONAL, MUST be present when `extends` is present.
- `claims`
    - REQUIRED (OPTIONAL in [SD-JWT-VC]): See
      [Claims Metadata](#claims-metadata)
- `display`
    - REQUIRED (OPTIONAL in [SD-JWT-VC]). See
      [Display Metadata](#display-metadata). At least one Display Metadata
      containing `simple` rendering MUST be present.
- `schema`
    - REQUIRED (OPTIONAL in [SD-JWT-VC]). An embedded JSON Schema document
      describing the structure of the Verifiable Credential.
- `schema_uri`
    - NOT SUPPORTED (OPTIONAL in [SD-JWT-VC]). Schema information MUST be
      embedded using `schema`.

### Display Metadata

- `lang`
    - REQUIRED, must be unique for every object in the `display` array.
- `summary` (not present in [SD-JWT-VC])
    - OPTIONAL. Contains a summary of the credential ( see
      [Credential Summary](#credential-summary)).
- `rendering`
    - OPTIONAL. Only `simple` rendering is supported.

#### Credential Summary

The optional `summary` field of the Display Metadata provides a summary of the
credential for the end user, and may contain `svg_id` identifiers from the
[Claim metadata](#claim-metadata) as placeholders for credential attributes. The
NL Wallet will render this field as a subtitle of the card, with the `svg_id`
identifiers replaced by the appropriate attribute values.

Example:

```json
"summary" : "Person data for {{firstname}} {{lastname}}"
```

If the values of the `firstname` and `lastname` are `John` and `Doe`
respectively, then in the NL Wallet this will be rendered as
`Person data for John Doe`.

Example display of a credential in compact card form, using the `summary` from
the example above:

```
+----------------------------+
| PID card                   | // `name` from Display Metadata
+----------------------------+
| Person data for John Doe   | // Credential Summary (`summary`) from Display Metadata.
|                            | // using {firstname} and {lastname} from claims
+----------------------------+
```

#### Simple Rendering

The NL Wallet supports `simple` rendering as specified, except the `uri` of
[Logo Metadata](#logo-metadata).

Rendering using `svg_templates` is not supported.

##### Logo metadata

- `uri`
    - REQUIRED. MUST use `data` URI scheme as defined in
      [RFC 2397](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2397) (no external
      links). Example:
      `"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vc..."` The
      following mime-types are supported: `image/jpeg`, `image/png`,
      `image/svg+xml`.

### Claims Metadata

- All leaf values in the credential MUST be selectable by a claim in the
  `claims` section (excluding reserved claims). Reserved claims: `vct`, `cnf`,
  `iss`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub`, `status`, `attestation_qualification`.
- Any credential containing values that are not selectable by one of the
  `claims` will be rejected.

_Supported Data types_

The NL Wallet supports rendering of claims that select any of the following
types:

- JSON types: `boolean`, `number` and `string`
- There is limited support to use the `format` property of JSON Schema to format
  dates. Only direct explicit properties can be used, i.e. no `$ref` and no
  `additionalProperties`, `patternProperties` or `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`
  constructs.
  Example:`{"properties": {"birth_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}}}`
- The NL Wallet does _not_ (yet) support claims that select a JSON `array` or
  `object` value.
- Type Metadata MUST only contain claim paths that select the supported types
  above. Any Type Metadata that contains claims that select a non-supported
  type, will be rejected.

#### Claim Metadata

- `display`
    - REQUIRED (OPTIONAL in [SD-JWT-VC]). At least one Claim Display Metadata
      object MUST be present in the array.
- `svg_id`
    - OPTIONAL. Only used for [Credential Summary](#credential-summary). SVG
      rendering is not supported.

#### Claim Display Metadata

- `lang`
    - REQUIRED. MUST be unique for every object in the `display` array.

### Extending types

Extending types is supported. [SD-JWT-VC] does not explicitly define how
extended types should relate to base types.

When processing types that extend one other, the following rules are applied:

- The `display` metadata entries are merged based on the `lang` field:
    - Entries within the base document that have the same language as the
      extending document are replaced entirely by the entry contained in the
      extending document. Individual properties for a `display` metadata entry
      are not merged.
    - Order: The order of the `display` metadata entries in the base document is
      maintained. New entries from extending documents are appended, based on
      the order from the extending document.
- The `claim` metadata entries are merged based on the `path` field:
    - The paths of the claims of an extending document MUST be a superset of the
      paths in the base document. This requirement exists so that the order of
      claims can be fully overridden by an extending document. Any extending
      document that does not have claims matching all paths from the base
      document will be rejected.
    - The `display` property of `claim` metadata entries is merged according to
      the same rules as the `display` property of the type metadata document,
      see above.
    - The `sd` property can only be overridden if the value is `allowed` (which
      is the default). Once this has been changed to `always` or `never`, this
      constitutes an end state for that property and it can no longer be
      overridden to another value in an extending document.
    - The `svg_id` of the extending document takes precedence. When the base
      document has `svg_id` set, but the extending document does not, the
      resulting document will not have an `svg_id`.
    - Type information for all claim paths MUST be defined in the JSON-schema.

## Profile considerations

### C1 - Credential contents must be presentable to the end user

_Issue_

Information necessary for proper presentation of claim data to the end user (
consumer of the claim) is not mandatory in [SD-JWT VC], making it difficult for
end users to understand the claims they receive and share.

_Motivation_

We aim to use Type Metadata for both the presentation and data definition for a
given credential type. From our standpoint, the Type Metadata must contain
sufficient information for properly presenting a credential (including all of
its attributes and Localized field labels) to an end user.

_Implication_

- `display` metadata is required for both the Type and Claims metadata.
- `claims` MUST be present in offered [Type Metadata](#type-metadata)
- All values in the credential MUST be referenced by a `claim` in the `claims`
  section (excluding reserved claims: `vct`, `cnf`, `iss`, `exp`, `iat`, `sub`,
  `status`, `attestation_qualification`). See
  [Claims Metadata](#claims-metadata).
- Data that is selected by claims must be renderable for the Wallet App. A
  `claim` path must select a type that can be rendered. See
  [Claims Metadata](#claims-metadata).
    - `object` types are not supported.
    - `array` types are NOT YET supported.

### C2 - Credential summary (based on contents) for optimized browsing

_Issue_

[SD-JWT VC] does not support defining a textual name or identifier of a specific
attestation for the end user, based on the attestation contents, one that sets
apart multiple attestations of the same type (e.g. 'Master degree computer
science' versus 'Master degree mathematics'). This makes it more difficult to
browse stored credentials and find the right one.

_Motivation_

To allow for an optimized browsing UX in a wallet we propose to add a `summary`
to the credential [Display Metadata](#display-metadata). The summary can be used
by the wallet to create a compact view for the credential. It will give the user
a meaningful and recognizable overview of the credential's content, which has
proven useful from our current UX explorations. The `summary` may contain
placeholders for actual values from the credential, similar to the templating
logic for `svg_template` rendering [SD-JWT-VC]. See
[Credential Summary](#credential-summary) for more details.

_Implication_

- `summary` as a new OPTIONAL field in the
  [Display Metadata](#display-metadata).
- The summary can be used in both rendering modes `simple` and `svg_template`

### C3 - No support for external resources

_Issue_

[SD-JWT VC] allows for refering to external resources in the following cases:

- Type metadata
    - `schema_uri`
- Logo metadata
    - `uri`

Downloading resources from external location introduces the following risks:

- Availability: when a resource is not available a fallback is needed
- Performance: when a resource takes time to be delivered to the end user, the
  user experience may degrade
- Privacy: fetching external resources introduces privacy risks, since user
  behavior may be tracked by the resource owner.

_Motivation_

To mitigate the risks mentioned we will currenty not allow the use of external
resources. Part of the risks might also be mitigated by requirements to the
scheme that NL Wallet is part of. Distributing Type Metadata (and related
resources) is not yet addressed in ARF or other frameworks.

_Implication_

- Type metadata
    - `schema_uri` is NOT supported
- Logo metadata
    - `uri`: only `data` URI scheme is supported

### C4 - Unambiguously select a locale for displaying credentials

_Issue_

[SD-JWT VC] allows a `lang` attribute to support localization in the Type
Metadata specification.

1. `lang` in [Display Metadata](#display-metadata)
1. `lang` in [Claim Metadata](#claim-metadata)

In [SD-JWT VC] there are no rules defined on what a consuming Wallet should
display when multiple items contain the same value for `lang`. This may result
to unexpected or undesired behavior.

_Motivation_

To avoid unexpected or undesired behavior we propose an additional restriction
on the collections that contain items that are only distinguished by the value
of the `lang` attribute.

_Implication_

- `lang` in [Display Metadata](#display-metadata) must be unique, per
  `rendering` method.
- `lang` in [Claim Metadata](#claim-metadata) must be unique.

### C5 - Allow attributes to be selectively disclosable by default

_Issue_

When disclosing an [SD-JWT+KB], attributes that are not selectively disclosable
will be included in every SD-JWT and are viewable by the relying party. This may
lead to unintentional disclosure of more information than was requested.

_Motivation_

To preserve privacy, we aim to disclose only the minimum necessary information.

_Implication_

When constructing an SD-JWT, we iterate over all attributes—whether values or
intermediary object nodes—and mark them as selectively disclosable by default,
unless their claim metadata explicitly specifies otherwise (i.e., `claim.sd` in
[Claim Metadata](#claim-metadata) is set to `never`).

As a result, we may treat more attributes as selectively disclosable than the
metadata strictly requires.

For example, if the SD-JWT contains an attribute address.street and the metadata
includes a claim for [`address`, `street`] with `claim.sd` set to `always`, we
also mark address as selectively disclosable.

Additionally, if `claim.sd` is set to `allowed`, we choose to make the
corresponding attribute selectively disclosable.
