# Onboarding

An organization can opt to join the [NL-Wallet Community][1]. This community is
intended for partners that are working on software that implements a verifier or
issuer which they want to test with NL-Wallet backend systems and mobile apps.

You can visit the [EDI page about the NL-Wallet Community][1] for more details
about how to join the NL-Wallet Community and which steps to follow.

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="title">Should you join the NL-Wallet Community?</p>
<p>The NL-Wallet Community is intended for organizations that develop issuers
and verifiers or other related softwares that would benefit from being able to
test within the NL-Wallet ecosystem, i.e., its backend and mobile apps.</p>
<p>If you just want to develop issuers, verifiers or other kinds of software,
you *can* do that [locally][2] without onboarding to our community platform.
Only when you have a specific need to test integrations with the platform
itself, would you need to consider onboarding with the NL-Wallet Community.</p>
