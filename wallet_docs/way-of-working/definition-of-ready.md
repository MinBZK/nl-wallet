# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready (DoR) is a checklist that ensures a User Story has been
sufficiently refined, understood, and prepared before it is accepted into a
development sprint. It confirms that the team has everything needed, including
clear scope and acceptance criteria, to immediately begin coding and testing the
item.

## Our Definition of ready

- Story has been given points.
- Everyone understands the goal, scope, and expected outcome.
- Testing strategy is defined (default is unit tests only).
- Design assets are available in Figma (for UI stories).
- Dependencies are identified (blocked by relation).
