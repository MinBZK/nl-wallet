# Release notes v0.4.0

## Upgrading

-   This release changes the identifiers used by the wallet and Wallet Provider
    to refer to the wallet's keys, invalidating existing keys and their
    identifiers. The WP's database will therefore have to be cleared when
    deploying this.
-   Specifying for which attributes a relying party is authorized in a
    certificate has been made credential format agnostic, meaning all existing
    certificates are invalid and should be regenerated to accomodate the new
    structure.

## New features

-   The wallet and Wallet Provider now use the SHA256 of the public keys to
    refer to the wallet's keys, so that the wallet's signing instructions to the
    WP are non-repudiable.
-   The wallet now supports issued attributes containing 'null' values.

## Code improvements

-   `ReaderRegistration` has been made credential format agnostic, meaning the
    attributes specified in the reader certificate for which the relying party
    is authorized to request them are specified in a manner that works for both
    mdoc and SD-JWT credentials.
