# Release notes v0.4.0

## Upgrading

- This release changes the identifiers used by the wallet and Wallet Provider to
  refer to the wallet's keys, invalidating existing keys and their identifiers.
  The WP's database will therefore have to be cleared when deploying this.
- Specifying for which attributes a relying party is authorized in a certificate
  has been made attestation format agnostic, meaning all existing certificates
  are invalid and should be regenerated to accomodate the new structure.
- The minimum size for the `ephemeral_id_secret` in the configuration of the
  `verification_server` has been increased from 16 to 32 bytes.

## New features

- The wallet and Wallet Provider now use the SHA256 of the public keys to refer
  to the wallet's keys, so that the wallet's signing instructions to the WP are
  non-repudiable.
- The wallet now supports issued attributes containing 'null' values.
- The PID issuer now includes a new attribute called the recovery code, which
  is computed as the HMAC of the user's BSN.

## Code improvements

- `ReaderRegistration` has been made attestation format agnostic, meaning the
  attributes specified in the reader certificate for which the relying party is
  authorized to request them are specified in a manner that works for both mdoc
  and SD-JWT attestations.
