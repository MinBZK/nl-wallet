# Release notes v0.4.0

## Upgrading

- This release changes the identifiers used by the wallet and Wallet Provider to
  refer to the wallet's keys, invalidating existing keys and their identifiers.
  The WP's database will therefore have to be cleared when deploying this.

## New features

- The wallet and Wallet Provider now use the SHA256 of the public keys to refer
  to the wallet's keys, so that the wallet's signing instructions to the WP are
  non-repudiable.
- The wallet now supports issued attributes containing 'null' values.
