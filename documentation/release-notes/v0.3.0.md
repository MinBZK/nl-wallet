# Release notes v0.3.0

## Upgrading

- This release contains several changes pertaining to key and app attestation:
  - Both key and app attestation will be performed for the iOS version of the wallet app.
  - For the Android version, only key attestation will be performed.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for iOS key and app attestation:
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been amended to support the specifics of iOS attested key usage. This is a backwards incompatible change.
  - A database table has been added to store Apple attested key information.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `ios` section, containing the team and bundle identifiers of the Wallet app, as well as a list of Apple Root CAs against which attestations are validated.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for Android key and app attestation:
  - A database table has been added to store Android attested key and integrity verdict information. Note that this also includes a restructuring of the database tables, which is a backwards incompatible change.
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been changed in a way that is backwards incompatible.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `android` section, which contains the following:
    - A list of root CA public keys, against which the certificate chain received during Android key attestation is validated. These can be either RSA or ECDSA keys, encoded in PKCS 8 in a Base64 string.
    - The package name of the Wallet app.
    - A list of hashes of the certificates under which the Wallet app is published in the Play Store.
- The embedded configuration server config and wallet config are now parsed and validated at build time.
  - This requires adding the `environment` property to the hosted `wallet-config.json` for all environments.
  - When running the app locally against a remote environment, the `CONFIG_DEV` environment variable must be set to the remote environment.
- The PID issuer now requires the configuration of Technical Attestation Schemas (TAS). It looks for JSON files on the filesystem relative
  to the binary. The names of the JSON files can be configured using the `PID_ISSUER__ISSUER__METADATA` environment variable or through the
  `issuer.metadata` key in the PID issuer TOML configuration.
- The settings now use a `__` for the prefix separator.

## New features

- Implement performing key and app attestation during registration in iOS app.
- Implement performing key attestation during registration in the Android app.
- Add processing of Apple key and app attestations to the Wallet Provider.
- Verification Server now requires that a Proof of Association is included when attestations from multiple documents are submitted by the Wallet. The Wallet includes the Proof of Association if this is the case.

## Bug fixes

- Fix house number in test data.
- Do not panic in `gba_hca_converter` when house number parsing fails.

## CI changes

- Add MR template.
- Change deployment files to use environment variables (except mock-relying-party and private keys of pid-issuer).
