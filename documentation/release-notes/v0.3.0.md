# Release notes v0.3.0

## Upgrading

- This release contains several changes pertaining to key and app attestation:
  - Both key and app attestation will be performed for the iOS version of the wallet app.
  - Both key and app attestation will be performed for the Android version of the wallet app.
  - The `wallet-config.json` needs to have a value for a new setting, `google_cloud_project_id`
  - The `google_cloud_project_id` needs to be set to whatever project numeric identifier is configured for Play Integrity enablement in the Play Store Console for the wallet app.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for iOS app and key attestation:
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been amended to support the specifics of iOS attested key usage. This is a backwards incompatible change.
  - A database table has been added to store Apple attested key information.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `ios` section, containing the team and bundle identifiers of the Wallet app, as well as a list of Apple Root CAs against which attestations are validated.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for Android key attestation:
  - A database table has been added to store Apple attested key information. Note that this also includes a restructuring of the database tables, which is a backwards incompatible change.
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been changed in a way that is backwards incompatible.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `android` section, containing a list of root CA public keys, against which the certificate chain received during Android key attestation is validated. These can be either RSA or ECDSA keys, encoded in PKCS 8 in a Base64 string.
- The embedded configuration server config and wallet config are now parsed and validated at build time.
  - This requires adding the `environment` property to the hosted `wallet-config.json` for all environments.
  - When running the app locally against a remote environment, the `CONFIG_DEV` environment variable must be set to the remote environment.
- The PID issuer now requires the configuration of Technical Attestation Schemas (TAS). It looks for JSON files on the filesystem relative
  to the binary. The names of the JSON files can be configured using the `PID_ISSUER__ISSUER__METADATA` environment variable or through the
  `issuer.metadata` key in the PID issuer TOML configuration.
- The settings now use a `__` for the prefix separator.

## New features

- Implement performing key and app attestation during registration in iOS app.
- Implement performing key and app attestation during registration in the Android app.
- Add processing of Apple key and app attestations to the Wallet Provider.
- Verification Server now requires that a Proof of Association is included when attestations from multiple documents are submitted by the Wallet. The Wallet includes the Proof of Association if this is the case.
- Issue PID data based on a generic metadata format in the form of SD-JWT VC Type Metadata.
- Send the SD-JWT VC Type Metadata along with the credential previews and signed mdocs from the issuer to the wallet.
- Add algorithm for unpacking mdoc namespaces to nested data structures for verification against SD-JWT VC Type Metadata documents.
- Validate attestations against their metadata in the issuer.

## Bug fixes

- Fix house number in test data.
- Do not panic in `gba_hca_converter` when house number parsing fails.

## CI changes

- Add MR template.
- Change deployment files to use environment variables (except mock-relying-party and private keys of pid-issuer).
