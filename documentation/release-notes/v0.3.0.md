# Release notes v0.3.0

## Upgrading

- This release makes key and app attestation mandatory for both the iOS and Android app, which is preformed during registration with the Wallet Provider. The wallet contains the following changes in order to implement this:
  - The `wallet-config.json` needs to have a value for a new setting, `google_cloud_project_id`. This value needs to be set to whatever project numeric identifier is configured for Play Integrity in the Play Store Console for the wallet app.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for iOS app and key attestation:
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been amended to support the specifics of iOS attested key usage. This is a backwards incompatible change.
  - A database table has been added to store Apple attested key information.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `ios` section, containing the team and bundle identifiers of the Wallet app, as well as a list of Apple Root CAs against which attestations are validated.
- The Wallet provider contains the following changes for Android key and app attestation:
  - A database table has been added to store Android attested key and integrity verdict information. Note that this also includes a restructuring of the database tables, which is a backwards incompatible change.
  - The signing of messages sent to the Wallet Provider has been changed in a way that is backwards incompatible.
  - The Wallet Provider configuration has been amended with an `android` section, which contains the following:
    - A list of root CA public keys, against which the certificate chain received during Android key attestation is validated. These can be either RSA or ECDSA keys, encoded in PKCS 8 in a Base64 string.
    - The package name of the Wallet app.
    - A boolean to indicate whether to allow side loading the wallet app when evaluating the integrity verdict as returned by Google.
    - A path to a file containing the credentials for a Google Cloud service account, which can be used to retrieve integrity verdicts.
    - A list of hashes of the certificates under which the Wallet app is published in the Play Store, against which the integrity verdict is checked.
- The embedded configuration server config and wallet config are now parsed and validated at build time.
  - This requires adding the `environment` property to the hosted `wallet-config.json` for all environments.
  - When running the app locally against a remote environment, the `CONFIG_DEV` environment variable must be set to the remote environment.
- The PID issuer now requires the configuration of Technical Attestation Schemas (TAS). It looks for JSON files on the filesystem relative
  to the binary. The names of the JSON files can be configured using the `PID_ISSUER__ISSUER__METADATA` environment variable or through the
  `issuer.metadata` key in the PID issuer TOML configuration.
- The settings now use a `__` for the prefix separator.
- The `issuer.` or `verifier.` prefixes of some of the items in the TOML configuration file(s) of the `wallet_server` must be removed.

## New features

- Implement performing key and app attestation during registration in iOS app.
- Implement performing key and app attestation during registration in the Android app.
- Add processing of Apple key and app attestations to the Wallet Provider.
- Verification Server now requires that a Proof of Association is included when attestations from multiple documents are submitted by the Wallet. The Wallet includes the Proof of Association if this is the case.
- Issue PID data based on a generic metadata format in the form of SD-JWT VC Type Metadata.
- Send the SD-JWT VC Type Metadata along with the credential previews and signed mdocs from the issuer to the wallet.
- Add algorithm for unpacking mdoc namespaces to nested data structures for verification against SD-JWT VC Type Metadata documents.
- Validate attestations against their metadata in the issuer.
- Add issuer_uri to MobileSecurityObject and verify it agains the SAN DNS name or URI in the issuer certificate.
- Both the PID issuer server and the verification server now support HSM keys in addition to software keys.

## Code improvements

- The part of `wallet_common` that implements communication between `wallet` and `wallet_provider` has been split off into a separate `wallet_account` crate. This new crate provides a `client` and `server` cargo feature, which allows separating the dependency tree for the `wallet` and `wallet_provider` respectively. This change also enables moving some other code from `wallet_common` to `platform_support`.
- The axum routers used by OpenID4VCI/OpenID4VP servers have been split off to a new crate called `openid4vc_server`. This makes these routers more reusable.
- The `wallet_server` crate has been split off into separate new crates for the `pid_issuer` and `verification_server`.

## Bug fixes

- Fix house number in test data.
- Do not panic in `gba_hca_converter` when house number parsing fails.

## CI changes

- Add MR template.
- Change deployment files to use environment variables (except mock-relying-party and private keys of pid-issuer).
