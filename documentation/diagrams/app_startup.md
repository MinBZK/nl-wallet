# App Startup

When the app is (cold) started the `wallet_core` is notified and given a multiple bridges so that it can call into the native iOS & Android world on its own merit. This process is documented in [initialization](#initialization).

Next to the main initialization of `wallet_core` we also setup two callbacks so that the `wallet_core` can notify the `wallet_app` of changes in its [configuration](#configuration) and [wallet lock](#wallet-lock) state.

## Initialization

This diagram captures the communication between the different app layers which occurs when the app is started.

Note that we check whether the `wallet_core` is already initialized, this is needed because the flutter engine can be destroyed while the native app (which includes `wallet_core`) is kept alive by the os. When this happens we want to rebind to the `wallet_core` instead of re-initializing it.

                wallet_app->>wallet_core: init()

            end

        end
        wallet_app->>user: UI
    deactivate user
```

## Extra callbacks

While the callback setup doesn't strictly (all) happen during the app startup (i.e. the streams are configured but the reference isn't passed on to `wallet_core` until the stream has an observer), it is relevant here because it is initiated at app startup and these callbacks have to be cleared when they become stale (i.e. `isInitialized()` returned `true` during the [initialization](#11-initialization)).

### Configuration

This stream provides app configuration data to the wallet_app (e.g. background lock timeout duration). And can be updated throughout the complete lifecycle of the app.

        wallet_app->>wallet_core: setConfigurationStream()
        wallet_app->>user: UI
    deactivate user
```

### Wallet lock

This stream provides information on the current wallet lock state (i.e. if the user is logged in and can view her attestations)

```
