As part of our software delivery process, we do pull- or merge requests. These
are reviewed before being merged to the main branch and checked for compliance
with our [definition of done](./documentation/wow/definition-of-done.md).

This small merge-request guide describes succinctly how we should create an MR
and how we do a so-called MR review.

1. Decide if this is a standard (default) or basic MR. A standard MR
   is intended for regular work, always has a related issue ticket
   and is checked for various aspects documented in our definition
   of done. A basic MR is for quick fixes and/or forgotten things
   and does not always have a related issue ticket, and is checked
   only for unwanted content in commits and for technical debt TODO
   issues.

2. When you've chosen the MR type, a template text body will be
   inserted. Here you link the related issue ticket (if it's a
   standard MR) and insert a short description. Note that a full
   description, with other important information like implementation
   decisions and context for code changes should be part of the
   related issue ticket. A basic MR should not require extensive
   explanation.

3. In some cases, one or more of the specifically to-be-checkmarked
   items is not applicable to this MR. To assist the reviewer, you can
   use ~~strikethrough~~ on a list item below to indicate that that
   specific item is not relevant to this MR (i.e., don't delete the
   line, but use strikethrough instead).

4. As the assignee of the MR, you implement the work in accordance
   with the definition of done; as a reviewer of the MR, you verify
   that such is the case.
